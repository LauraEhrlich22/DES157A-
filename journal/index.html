                <h2>Entry: </h2>
                <p class="impotant-links-spacing">1.This image is interesting because it shows a contrast between the different ways that I see my condition. I think it uses framing as it puts a frame around the main essence of what I see: static. The frame itself is colorful and allows for hope, opportunity, and imagination that can trap the static itself from escaping.<br>2. The image is supposed to be like the cover image of the collection which can help to introducce the images that more closely show the way that I see things. <br> 3. I think that this collections says a lot about me because it really displays the way that I live through the world and even those with the same condition can still experience the same symptoms differently.

                <p class="impotant-links-spacing">I think that this image is about a couple Johanna and friends after completing an escape room in Hong Kong. Also based on the caption it seems like this escape room happened at midnight which can help show how even more proud they were. I think that this image uses focusing on the subjects as its main strength of communication the story. The most obvious part about the image is the midniht in honkong caption, but I also find it to be the most mysterious. Why midnight?</p>

                <p class="impotant-links-spacing">As someone who is a double major in Cinema and Digital Media as well as Design, I’ve always appreciated finding the little things in media, whether it be thinking about what a tiny little dot could mean in terms of what the creator was trying to say. With this being said, I agreed with a lot of the points of the article and the importance of “being a detective” and looking for the little things because they matter too. I also thought that pointing out the importance of asking questions when looking at these types of images was important too. Often times we talk about what we think, but it is also important to understand what other people think as that can really shape our thoughts and views.

                <h2>Entry:</h2>
                <p class="impotant-links-spacing">I think that reading an article about these types of pop-ups was interesting especially to think about from a user perspective. In terms of pop-ups and overlays I definitely can think of many times when I have experienced them and overall has been a bad experience because they come on unexpectedly and can be hard to get rid of. This was one of the biggest takeaways that I got from the reading about being mindful in regards to when best to utilize overlays in a way that is more positive to the user. Aside from this, I also found the information about thinking about placement and sizing in terms of mobile important especially, again as a user being impacted by this and not being able to exist out of a pop up because of the way it was poorly sized for mobile.

                <p>When it comes to forms, one of the most important things to think about is how to keep the user engaged. I know that there are many times when I have clicked off of a form purely because it was too long or the questions were requiring too much effort. The article recommends that these are the things to zero in on. With this being said, </p>
