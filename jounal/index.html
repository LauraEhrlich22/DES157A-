                <p class="impotant-links-spacing">	When it comes to forms, one of the most important things to think about is how to keep the user engaged. I know that there are many times when I have clicked off of a form purely because it was too long or the questions were requiring too much effort. The article recommends that these are the things to zero in on. With this being said, when I create forms this is going to be the first and foremost thing that I focus on in terms of being aware of both the length as well as the kinds of questions I am asking and where they are placed.

                <p>Personally, I really like the way that duolingo does their form design becuase of the way they make it feel simple and interactive. I think this is achieved with their use of images.
