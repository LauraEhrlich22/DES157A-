    <h1>Filling out the Avatar Form</h1>
    <img src="avatar_form.PNG">
    <p>Overall, they liked the ability to create their own avatar even though it was simple in terms of what they could do to input it. The checkbox feature was confusing, so for them being able to only select one was important. I also noticed confusing with the page size and scrolling on click of the color options.</p>
    <h1>When you get a letter</h1>
    <img src="alien_points.png">
    <p>The most amount of confusion for my project was with when they get a letter or when they don't. I think that part of that was because the game was buggy, but I was able to confirm that adding in animations would probably help the overall choesion of the rules.</p>
    <h1>How you Win</h1>
    <img src="winning_game.png">
    <p>A lot of the time, the message at the top, telling the user that they won was overlooked. I think adding a screen at the end showing the final score and that someone won as well as the option to play again would help with this problem.</p>
