    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am hoping to update my game on project to help it look more cohesive as well as have more functionalities.</p>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>Overall, my goals not only include updating the design, but also adding my originally planned elements to the project. Right now it is incredibly simplistic, but I would like to add more sounds as well as an animation that makes it look like the ball is shooting through the hoop or missing the hoop depending on what the result is. I am also hoping to add more features to the game that relate more to the basketball version of the game of PIG. This would include adding a way for the user to see what letter of pig they are on.</p>
    <h1>Design Strategies</h1>
    Right now, the game feels pretty clunky and a lot of the spacing is off centered in the actual game. This is something that I would like to fix so it feels more put together. In my original design I also had an addition of a hoop in the background to be able to be shot into, so that would be added as well as updating the restart game or quit buttons. Finally, I would like to fix the overall spacing, so it feels less crowded. This would include adding animations from the start to the gameplay screen as well as adjusting the padding for buttons especially when the text is longer.
    <h1>Interaction Strategies</h1>
    <p>	Going off of the part about adding more animations, I’d like to use those to make the experience more seamless. THis would mean being able to fade from the start to the middle as well as adding a screen at the end that would tell the user the game is over, who one, and the final scores. Along with this, adding animations to the ball for when it is shot as well as when there is a pass could provide a more enjoyable experience for the user. I think that with these additions it can help make the game more clear as the feedback will help signal to the user exactly what is happening.
    </p>
    <h1>Experiece Goals</h1>
    <p>	As aforementioned, I really want the interface to be seamless, but also incredibly satisfying for the user. I would be able to accomplish this by adding little animations for each interaction. With that, the user would never get bored, but they would also not be too overwhelmed by any other autoplaying animations. By isolating the animation just to be on click I’m hoping for it to help guide the user along throughout the game from start to finish. I also think that adding background music could help make the game feel more intense and could potentially help the user get more into the game.
